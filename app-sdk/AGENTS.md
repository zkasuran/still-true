# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

A React application built with the Sanity App SDK (`@sanity/sdk-react`). It is not a Sanity Studio. The app reads and writes content in a Sanity project through SDK hooks, and runs inside the organization's Sanity Dashboard, in development and when deployed. The `sanity` CLI runs it with Vite under the hood.

## Key files

- `src/App.tsx`: entry point. The `SanityApp` component takes a `config` array with `projectId` and `dataset`. All SDK hooks must be used inside `SanityApp`.
- `sanity.cli.ts`: CLI config with the organization ID and app entry path.

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: starts the dev server on port 3333, but the app only renders inside the Sanity Dashboard. The CLI prints a Dashboard URL to open. Viewing it requires a signed-in Sanity account, so a human must complete authentication in the browser.
- `npm run build`: production build.
- `npm run deploy`: deploy to the Sanity Dashboard.

Environment variables prefixed with `SANITY_APP_` are bundled into the app.

## Deploying without prompts

For the standard App SDK config, create the app explicitly on the first deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy -- --create --title "My App" --yes --json
```

If `app` uses `defineApplication`, omit `--create`; that deployment flow already creates the app on its first run.

For the standard config, `--create` works even when the organization already has other apps. `app.title` in `sanity.cli.ts` can supply the title instead of `--title`. Add `--dry-run` to preview the deployment without creating or uploading anything.

Save `application.id` from the JSON response as `deployment.appId` in `sanity.cli.ts`. For later deploys, omit `--create` and run `npm run deploy -- --yes --json`. `--create` rejects a config that already has an app ID.

Agent terminals may disable interactive prompts even with a PTY (`TERM=dumb`). Use these flags rather than changing terminal settings or calling the applications API directly. Run `npm run deploy -- --help` to check which flags the installed CLI supports.

This app is not a Studio. For a Studio's first hosted deployment, use `sanity deploy --url <hostname> --yes`; `studioHost`, if used in config, belongs at the top level, not inside `deployment`.

## Working with the App SDK

If the Sanity MCP server is available, call its `get_sanity_rules` tool with the `app-sdk` rule before writing SDK code. That rule is the maintained guide and supersedes the notes below.

Essentials:

- Data hooks suspend while loading. Wrap every data-fetching component in `<Suspense>`, keep one fetching hook per component, and always pass a `fallback` to `SanityApp`.
- Fetch lists with `useDocuments` (or `usePaginatedDocuments`). They return document handles, not full documents. Spread a handle into `useDocumentProjection` to display fields, or into `useDocument` and `useEditDocument` for real-time editing.
- Use `documentId` as the React key when rendering document lists, never the array index.
- Do not hold document field values in `useState` and save on submit. Write through `useEditDocument` on change so content stays in sync with the Content Lake.
- Prefer handles plus projections over raw GROQ. Reach for `useQuery` only when a complex query genuinely needs it.
